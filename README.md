# Workbook 2 Workshop: Financial Calculators
Capstone 1: E-commerce
Application Development: Workshop 1. 

Description
In this project, I showcase my newly learned skills of JS by creating a Financial Calculator website. This websites demonstrates a combination of JS, HTML and CSS. In this demonstration, I have two calculators. For Css, I utilize Bootstrap and MaterializeCss for a reponsive framework and modern design. I have made 2 pages consisting of my mortgage calculator and compound interest calculator. For my work, I have started building out the framework using Visual Studio Code, developing a theme and then building my code around that theme for a fully-functioning display website. I have honed my fresh skills, in addition with HTML and CSS to fully build out the visual display for a calculator.

Description
The Mortage Calculator displays how much a monthly payment for a loan will be. The Compound Interest Calculator calculates the future value of a one-time deposit assumign compound interest. It is used to help you decided how much a CD will be worth when it matures.
